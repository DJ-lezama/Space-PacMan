# Space PacMan

This innovative project reimagined the iconic Pac-Man arcade game, introducing a new version dubbed "Space Pac-Man." In this version, the game's visual elements underwent a significant transformation, embracing a space-themed aesthetic. The familiar yellow Pac-Man character was re-envisioned as a spaceship, navigating through a cosmic maze rather than the original's pixelated corridors. The ghosts, adversaries in the classic game, were transformed into alien ghosts.

To enhance the gameplay experience and introduce dynamic interactions, the project utilized the Strategy design pattern. This design pattern allowed for the implementation of various behaviors for the alien ghosts, making their movements and actions more unpredictable and challenging for the player. Each ghost could exhibit different strategies, adding depth and complexity to the game.

A notable improvement was made to Blinky, one of the ghosts. In the classic game, Blinky is known for his direct and relentless pursuit of Pac-Man. In Space Pac-Man, Blinky's artificial intelligence was significantly enhanced using the A* algorithm, a powerful pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm. This advancement allowed Blinky to navigate the space-themed maze more intelligently, using strategic targeting to chase the player's spaceship. The A* algorithm enabled Blinky to calculate the shortest path to its target, taking into account the various obstacles and the dynamic nature of the game environment.

Overall, this project not only paid homage to the original Pac-Man game but also pushed its boundaries by incorporating modern programming techniques and innovative design concepts. The result was a fresh and exciting experience that maintained the core essence of the classic game while introducing new challenges and visual elements that resonated with the theme of space exploration.
